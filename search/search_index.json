I want to share all of this with anyone who is interested, which is why I created this website..</p> <p>I founded and managed the Scientometrics Centre at HSE University, leading numerous bibliometrics and research evaluation projects for clients ranging from Elsevier and Sberbank to the French Embassy in Russia. My work has been published in Research Evaluation, Scientometrics, the Journal of Informetrics and JASIST, to name a few. I have also developed and taught a master's-level course on applied research evaluation for university managers, written and implemented an online scientometrics manual in Russian, and managed a popular Telegram channel on science policy.</p> <p>After the channel was reported to the state security authorities for being too liberal, I had to leave my country. Since 2024, I am a senior advisor at E-Quadrat Science &amp; Education in Berlin. We advise universities, governments and businesses worldwide on research management, evaluations, rankings, and science communication.
